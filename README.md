# School Planner Mobile Application


## Description
This is a mobile application that I built for a school assignment. It was built for Android specifically, but could be utilized on iOS as well. It was built on .NET Maui which you'll see that it's all C#. It's currently on my Google Play account, so if you're interested in downloading, you can message me and I can grab the apk for you. Below is what the application can do!

## Project status
All of the pull requests were done on GitLab for the course which is why you won't see any in this repository. With that, I don't have plans to add to this project anytime soon as I'm working full time and have other priorities. Let me know if you see any issues and I can look into fixing them üëç
